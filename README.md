HW4: I thought I knew what I was doing for callback functions but now I am not so sure.... 

The goals for the 2 callbacks were:
- contact me button: display my phone number when that button in the nav bar is pressed
- hello button: display a welcome message when hello is clicked

I see why they aren't working but I am really not sure what to add to make them functional
